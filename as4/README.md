One of the problems in this dataset is that the data is wildly varying. Some have quotes around them, some don't,
and some have strange annotations like parenthesis around the years. 

The one small cleanup to this problem is to remove all parenthesis from the years in this data set.
This allows people who want to parse this data to easily retrieve the years without having to deal
with the random parenthesis around it. This is one small step to standarding the data set that is 
all over the place with the data formatting.
